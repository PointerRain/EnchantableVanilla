# EnchantableVanilla
EnchantableVanilla broadens the enchantability of items in Minecraft while keeping everything vanilla.
It does this by making minimal changes to the vanilla item tags and enchantment definitions.
This way it is still subject to the same enchantment restrictions as vanilla, but for more items.

If you have any issues, bugs, suggestions, or requests, contact pointer_rain on GitHub or Discord.

## Knockback Sticks
Makes sticks enchantable with knockback (I or II) in an anvil.

## Enchantable Hats
Makes hats enchantable with helmet-specific enchantments using an anvil.  
Heads, skulls, and carved pumpkins can additionally be enchanted with:
- Aqua Affinity
- Respiration (I, II, III)

## Sword-like Mace
Makes maces enchantable a bit more like swords in an anvil.  
Maces can be additionally enchanted with:
- Knockback (I, II)
- Looting (I, II, III)
- Sweeping Edge (I, II, III)

Maces cannot be enchanted with sharpness because they are not sharp weapons.

## Enchantable Bows
Makes bows enchantable like crossbows and crossbows enchantable like bows.  
Bows can additionally be enchanted with:
- Multishot
- Piercing (I, II, III, IV)
- ~~Quick Charge (I, II, III)~~

Though bows can technically be enchanted with Quick Charge, it will not function.
Blame Mojang for that.  
Like with crossbows, bows cannot be enchanted with both Multishot and Piercing.

Crossbows can additionally be enchanted with:
- Flame
- Infinity
- Power (I, II, III, IV, V)
- Punch (I, II)

Like with bows, crossbows cannot be enchanted with both Infinity and Mending.
